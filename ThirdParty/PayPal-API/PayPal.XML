            Common Response Fields from a PayPal API call.

            <remarks>
            <h2>Common Response Fields</h2>
            <p>
                The PayPal API always returns common fields in addition to fields that are specific to
                the requested PayPal API operation.</p>
            <h2>Error Responses</h2>
            <p>
                If the ACK value is not Success, API response fields may not be returned. An error
                response has the following general format.</p>
            <p>
                Additional pass-through information may appear in the L_ERRORPARAMIDn and
                L_ERRORPARAMVALUEn fields.</p>
            <h2>Logging API Operations</h2>
            <p>
                You should log basic information from the request and response messages of each PayPal
                API operation you execute. You must log the Correlation ID from the response message,
                which identifies the API operation to PayPal and which must be provided to Merchant
                Technical Support if you need their assistance with a specific transaction.</p>
            <p>
                All responses to PayPal API operations contain information that may be useful for
                debugging purposes. In addition to logging the Correlation ID from the response
                message, you can log other information, such as the transaction ID and timestamp, to
                enable you to review a transaction on the PayPal website or through the API. You could
                implement a scheme that logs the entire request and response in a “verbose” mode;
                however, you should never log the password from a request.</p>

            messages explaining the failure.
            - FailureWithWarning indicates that the operation failed and that there are
